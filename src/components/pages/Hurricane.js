                    <p><span className='bold'>Overview: </span>(Fictional scenario) Hurricane Catherine (Category 5) severely damaged the coast of Charleston, South Carolina.
                        There are multiple fallen trees, downed powerlines, and large pieces of debris in the coastal
                        communities. The iClean robotâ€™s task is to clean up small pieces of
                        debris (not shown in simulation) while gathering information about the larger debris objects
                        through the view of the vision sensor and camera. The iClean robot is useful because a) it allows
                        for an unmanned robot to inspect the dangerous area first without putting human lives in danger,
                        b) it gathers information about what kinds of large objects need to be address/cleaned up by a
                        human crew, and c) it cleans up small debris along the way (this is not visually represented in the
                        simulation). The identification of the kinds of debris objects will help disaster recovery team
                        know which kinds of trucks/people to send to that area. For example, if one area has several
                        fallen trees, it would be necessary to send out a crew with multiple trucks to pulverize the trees.
                        If another area has mostly downed powerlines, then a powerline crew should be sent to that
                        location. If all types of debris are found, the robot can show the area in which that specific debris
                        is located, thus specifying where to send specific types of clean-up crews.

                        <span className='bold'>Technical: </span>Using the CoppeliaSim software, I followed one of the CoppeliaSim tutorials to
                        create a "BubbleRob". Then, I edited this BubbleRob (renamed "iClean") to include more sensors. I
                        edited the code to prevent the iClean from bumping into things while moving backwards. I added
                        cubiods to the scene to represent downed powerlines, trees, and large debris objects. The iClean has cameras
                        that allow the user to see the scene from the iClean's point of view. The iClean moves automatically and avoids
                        bumping into debris.</p>
